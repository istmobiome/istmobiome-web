During the course of this project we created, organized, and hosted two marine microbiome workshops in Panama. Our objective was to bring together experts from various fields to discuss questions about the ecology, evolution, and function of host-microbiome interactions. The goals of the workshops were two-fold: to synthesize discussions into whitepapers and to build cross-disciplinary collaborations.
