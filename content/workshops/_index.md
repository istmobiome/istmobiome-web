During the course of this project we created, organized, and hosted four workshops/symposia in Panama (**3 in-person and 1 virtual**). The objective was to bring together experts from various fields to discuss questions about the ecology, evolution, and function of host-microbiome interactions. The goals of the workshops were two-fold: to synthesize discussions into whitepapers and to build cross-disciplinary collaborations.
