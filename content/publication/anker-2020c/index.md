abstract: A new laomediid genus, *Strianassa* **gen. nov**., is established to accommodate a new eastern Pacific species of mud-shrimp, *Strianassa lerayi* **sp. nov**. The holotype and single specimen of the new species was collected on a shallow subtidal flat at Isla Afuerita, Canales de Afuera, Coiba Archipelago, Panama. *Strianassa* **gen. nov**. appears to be most closely related to *Axianassa* Schmitt, 1924 and *Heteroaxianassa* Sakai, 2016, differing from both of them by the dorsal surface of the rostrum armed with teeth; the third maxilliped with an exopod and a set of setobranchs; and the epipodal complex of the fourth pereiopod including a small podobranch. In addition, *Axianassa ngochoae* Anker, 2010 and *Heteroaxianassa heardi* (Anker, 2011) are recorded for the first time from New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea, respectively, representing minor extensions of their previously known distributional ranges. The validity of *Heteroaxianassa* is discussed.
